## About
I am an AI Engineer and researcher based in London. I recently completed my MSc in Artificial Intelligence at [Queen Mary University of London](https://www.qmul.ac.uk/) as a [Chevening Scholar](https://www.chevening.org/).  

My research focuses on multimodal machine learning and audio reasoning with large language models. My Master‚Äôs thesis, *SAR-LM: Symbolic Audio Reasoning with Large Language Models*, was accepted at the [LLM4MA Workshop (ISMIR 2025)](https://m-a-p.ai/LLM4Music/) in Daejeon, Korea, where I will present it in an **oral spotlight session on September 26, 2025**. The work is also under review at ICASSP 2026.  

Before moving to London, I worked for two years as a software engineer, building backend systems and REST APIs for AI-driven products. My focus was on designing clean architectures, developing secure and optimized APIs, and improving reliability and performance.  

I earned my Bachelor's degree in Computer Engineering from Noshirvani University of Technology, where my research included deep learning for breast cancer detection and COVID-19 diagnosis from medical images, as well as EEG-based imagined speech classification. During this time, I also worked as a Teaching Assistant for the Data Structures course.

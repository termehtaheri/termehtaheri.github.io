## Research

My research focuses on multimodal machine learning and audio reasoning with large language models.  
I am especially interested in how AI can connect sound, language, and music to build interpretable systems that move beyond recognition toward deeper understanding.

- **Taheri, T.**, Ma, Y., & Benetos, E. (2025). [*SAR-LM: Symbolic Audio Reasoning with Large Language Models*](https://openreview.net/pdf?id=krBCxIE9bs). *Proceedings of the 1st Workshop on Large Language Models for Music & Audio (LLM4MA), ISMIR 2025* (oral spotlight presentation).  
  This work introduces SAR-LM, a modular pipeline that translates audio into symbolic, interpretable features (speech transcripts, sound events, music notes, chords) for reasoning with LLMs. Evaluated on three benchmarks (MMAU, MMAR, OmniBench), SAR-LM achieves competitive results while offering transparent error analysis. The paper highlights interpretability as its primary contribution and is also **under review at ICASSP 2026**.

  This work proposes EMFSG-Net, an ensemble meta-feature space generator designed to improve breast cancer classification from ultrasound images. It achieved 97.96% accuracy and a 96.2% F1-score on the BUSI dataset, outperforming existing models.

- Omranpour, H., Mohammadi Ledari, Z., & **Taheri, M.** (2023). [*Presentation of encryption method for RGB images based on an evolutionary algorithm using chaos functions and hash tables*](https://link.springer.com/article/10.1007/s11042-022-13734-x). *Multimedia Tools and Applications, 82*(6), 9343â€“9360.  
  This paper presents a novel RGB image encryption technique that combines chaos theory, evolutionary algorithms, and cryptographic hash functions to achieve lightweight yet robust image encryption.

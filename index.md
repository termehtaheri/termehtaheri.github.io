  <h1>Termeh Taheri</h1>
  <p>
    I am an AI Engineer and researcher based in London, with a Masterâ€™s degree in Artificial Intelligence from 
    <a href="https://www.qmul.ac.uk/" target="_blank">Queen Mary University of London</a>, 
    where I studied as a 
    <a href="https://www.chevening.org/" target="_blank">Chevening Scholar</a>. 
    My research explores multimodal machine learning and audio reasoning with large language models. 
    I am particularly interested in how AI can connect sound, language, and music to build systems that move beyond recognition and towards deeper understanding.
